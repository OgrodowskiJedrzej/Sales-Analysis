# Sales Analysis of modelling shop
Simple project to learn SQL queries and visualization of data in matplotlib.

## Introduction
The main goal was to learn how SQL works in conjunction with Pandas. After that, I aimed to create visualizations based on the resulting tables. I adopted a new plotting convention inspired by the book Storytelling with Data by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic. My focus was on creating clean, simple graphs in a consistent convention.

# Database
I used sample MySql database which is available below:
https://www.mysqltutorial.org/getting-started-with-mysql/mysql-sample-database/

The MySQL sample database schema consists of the following tables:
- customers: stores customerâ€™s data.
- products: stores a list of scale model cars.
- productlines: stores a list of product lines.
- orders: stores sales orders placed by customers.
- orderdetails: stores sales order line items for every sales order.
- payments: stores payments made by customers based on their accounts.
- employees: stores employee information and the organization structure such as who reports to whom.
- offices: stores sales office data.

## Technologies used:
